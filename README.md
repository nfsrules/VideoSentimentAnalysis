# VideoSentimentAnalysis
Implementation of gender and sentiment recognition on real-time video streams. 

## Installation

1. <strong>Install dlib v19.9</strong>

Pre-requisites:
* Have Python 3 installed. On macOS, this could be installed from homebrew or even via standard Python 3.6 downloaded installer from https://www.python.org/download. On Linux, just use your package manager.

* On macOS:
    * Install XCode from the Mac App Store (or install the XCode command line utils).
    * Have homebrew installed
* On Linux:
    * For a full list of apt packages required, check out the example Dockerfile and copy what's installed there.
    * These instructions assume you are using Ubuntu 16.04 or newer. If you are using 14.04, you can try these installation instructions instead to work around the old CMake version.
* These instructions assume you don't have an nVidia GPU and DONâ€™T have Cuda and cuDNN installed and don't want GPU acceleration (since none of the current Mac models support this).


Clone repository:

`git clone https://github.com/davisking/dlib.git`


Build dlib for Python 3:

`cd dlib
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DDLIB_USE_CUDA=0 -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .`
